# Week 7: State Management

This week focused on managing state using tools like Context API and Redux Toolkit.

## What I Worked On:

I developed a website called OlaStore, which showcases a variety of shoes. Upon logging into the website, users fill out a form. After submission, a welcome page briefly appears, then automatically redirects to the landing page where products are displayed.

# also showed react routing

### Current Features:

- User login with username input
- Welcome screen
- Product display on the landing page

### To Be Completed:

- Add-to-cart functionality
- Product detail view

## How to use:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install dependencies by running npm install.
4. Start the application with npm run dev.
